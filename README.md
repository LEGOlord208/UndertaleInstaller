# Introduction
Ever wanted to jump to a specific part of Undertale easily?  
[Flowey's Time Machine](https://crumblingstatue.github.io/FloweysTimeMachine/) already makes save files,  
but you have to backup them and stuff, every time... And Annoying dog could appear :|

Welp, I'm here to **fix that**!

# UndertaleSandbox
UndertaleSandbox does a few things.  

1. It searches for downloaded file0 and ini files. (Reads latest modified)  
 - If file0 was not found it asks for the location.  
 - If the INI was not found, it uses the existing INI.  
2. It backs everything up.  
3. It tries to remove annoying dog (resolving conflicts).  
4. It copies the files over.  
5. It starts undertale.  
6. It restores the backups.  

Now, it might not work for you. But hopefully, you can resolve that by editing  
the `.ui_config` file and set paths to their correct values.

# Note
The program **should** backup your data, but just in case anything goes wrong:  
I take no responsibility if any data is lost.

Now now, it's just a game anyways. Don't worry, it'll probably be fine.
